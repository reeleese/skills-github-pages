title: Welcome
---

Welcome to my blog. I made this to save my friends and family from my rants and lectures. This outlet is a way for me to get my thoughts out and to spare my loved ones some time. I know that if you are reading this, it's because you're choosing to and so I feel no guilt about wasting your time. You're doing this to yourself!

The title "Prepare to Die" is a reference to a game that is very dear to me. Dark Souls, specifically the prepare to die edition. Without it, I don't know where I would be today. Perhaps I'll write a post about it some day.
